1 : Choose predition algorithm, 1 for Prophet 2 for Holt-Winter's.
3 : Days of data to feed to the model.
0 : Time in minues to collect delta values for, in order to calculate threshold.
N : Y or N, whether or not to Increase threshold's accuracy basedon the collected values' distribution. it's raccomanded  if ,in the previous, step a very short time was chosen
90 : The Anomaly detection precision in perecentage. The gretaer this value, the more the values that will be collected.
